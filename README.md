# Assignment: Refactoring the Horiseon website

**User Story**

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

**Acceptance Criteria**

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

**Description**

This project is my attempt of refactoring the Horiseon's existing website homepage. 

The purposes of this refactoring is to make the previous code more efficient, comprehensible and accessible, through HTML5 and CSS best practice, and meeting the acceptance criteria as shown below. Refactoring should also result in improved search engine optimization. 

The modification does not change the displayed styling of the page, only the underlying code.

**Features**

* Semantic HTML Structure: Replaced generic container elements and class names with appropriate semantic elements and semantic class names.
* Page Headings: Ensured that heading elements follow a logical, sequential order.
* Improved Image Accessibility: Added alt attributes to <img> tags to improve the experience of users visiting the page using assisitive technology.
* Page Title: Added keyword driven page title to <title> element to improve SEO and help users with disabilities more quickly understand the page's content and purpose.
* Comments: Added throughout both HTML and CSS files, highlighting the improved semantic structure and changes.
