# Assignment: Refactoring the Horiseon website

**Description**

This project is my attempt of refactoring the Horiseon's existing website homepage. 

The purposes of this refactoring is to make the previous code more efficient, comprehensible and accessible, through HTML5 and CSS best practice, and meeting the acceptance criteria as shown below. Refactoring should also result in improved search engine optimization. 

The modification does not change the displayed styling of the page, only the underlying code.
